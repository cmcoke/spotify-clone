    This line of code is using the supabaseClient object to get the public URL of a file from the songs bucket in Supabase Storage.

    The getPublicUrl method is called with song.song_path as an argument to specify the path of the file to get the public URL for.

    The result of the method call is an object with a data property that contains an object with information about the file, including its public URL. 
    
    This property is destructured into a variable called songData using the syntax const { data: songData } = ....

    In summary, this line of code gets the public URL of a file from the songs bucket in Supabase Storage and stores it in a variable called songData.
